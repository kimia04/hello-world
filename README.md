Computational Biology Interim 2021

Hello! I'm a high school student engaged in a Computational Biology interim course. I have been learning Python and Linux asynchronously with a program developed by Dr. Feltus of Clemson University. Prior to this course, I never touched programming languages -- my CS requirement was fulfilled by a Google Sites design class. I did not think I would find programming interesting, but I kinda do. It is confusing, but intriguing.
